Objective:
Build an innovative AI-powered research paper generation platform with a rich, attractive frontend and robust Python backend APIs. Enable seamless user workflows for uploading research abstracts, generating structured academic papers with AI, formatting citations, and collaborative editing.

Backend (Python Flask / FastAPI)
Develop RESTful APIs for user authentication (login, register, session management) using JWT tokens for security.

Create endpoints for:

Uploading research topics/abstracts (accept text or file input).

Triggering asynchronous AI processing tasks (integrate with language model services like OpenAI API, or custom fine-tuned models).

Fetching live data from academic APIs (CrossRef, Semantic Scholar) with rate limiting and caching to optimize performance.

Summarization and content generation services that return segmented paper sections.

Citation generation and formatting APIs supporting multiple styles (IEEE, APA, MLA, Chicago).

Versioned paper drafts saving and retrieval with real-time edit conflict handling.

Plagiarism and bias scanning service integrations using third-party APIs.

Use FastAPI for asynchronous request handling and high performance or Flask for simplicity and flexibility depending on your preference.

Secure all endpoints using HTTPS with TLS/SSL and implement data validation and sanitization.

Integrate MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, paper drafts, session data, citation metadata, and AI-generated outputs.

Implement background worker queues (e.g., Celery with Redis) to handle long-running AI generation tasks and API calls efficiently.

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
Build a clean, modern, and responsive UI with intuitive navigation. Use CSS animations and transitions for an engaging experience (e.g., section fades, button hover effects, loading spinners).

Homepage features dynamic text sliders or typewriter effects presenting platform benefits vividly.

Login and registration forms with validation feedback and animated input focus states.

User dashboard showing upload widget (drag-and-drop or file select) with progress bars and real-time notifications for status updates.

Paper preview panel using rich text rendering or markdown-to-HTML conversion to display generated sections and references attractively.

Citation format selector dropdown with live preview of formatted references.

Modal dialogs or inline suggestion boxes to accept/reject AI writing recommendations.

Download buttons for DOCX / PDF exports with clear success animations or toasts.

Use vanilla JS or lightweight frameworks (e.g., Alpine.js) for interactivity, or optionally integrate with React/Vue if preferred later.

Ensure accessibility with proper semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles.

Database Design
User Collection/Table: userId, name, email, passwordHash, roles, registeredAt, lastLogin, preferences

Papers Collection/Table: paperId, userId, originalInput (topic/abstract), generatedSections {intro, methods, results, discussion,...}, citations, formattingStyle, status (draft, finalized), createdAt, updatedAt

Citations: citationId, paperId, sourceMetadata (DOI, URL, authors, publication date), formattedText, verifiedStatus

Tasks Queue: taskId, paperId, taskType (fetch, summarize, generate, cite), status, timestamps

Additional Suggestions
Use Flask/FastAPI middleware for logging, error handling, and request tracing to improve debugging and monitoring.

Implement JWT token refresh mechanism and secure cookie storage for session persistence.

Use environment variables or configuration files for API keys and secrets, supporting seamless deployment.

Containerize the app with Docker for dev/prod consistency.

Optionally add WebSocket or server-sent events for live UI updates related to AI processing status.
